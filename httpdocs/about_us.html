      <p>Raidsport was born when I looked at buying various sports clothing for my young son who was growing into a budding athlete.  I found it increasingly difficult to find quality children's wear that had the correct fit and served it's purpose for the sport required.  </p>

      <p>Being a qualified clothing designer I decided to look at producing my own garments.  I made up patterns and samples and then between the two of us we put them to the test finding out what was comfortable and needed for each discipline and so the range grew into adults wear.  After many months of perseverance I have now found quality manufacturers who understand our needs and produce some of the top brands in the very same factories where our Raidsport garments are made. </p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>Raidsport stives to provide quality product at good prices using only the best light weight sweat wicking fabrics that stretch to give great muscle support and help you look the part.  It hopes to give you the edge wherever you are training or competing.</p>

      <p>Here at Raidsport we hope to offer you a variety of sportswear for your discipline, with a friendly and quick service. We have always believed in being the type of company that we would want to deal with if we were you.</p>

      <p>Thanks for visiting and be sure to contact us should you have any questions, queries or comments. </p>
